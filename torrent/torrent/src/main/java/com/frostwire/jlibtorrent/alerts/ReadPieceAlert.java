 * This alert is posted when the asynchronous read operation initiated by
 * a call to torrent_handle::read_piece() is completed. If the read failed, the torrent
 * is paused and an error state is set and the buffer member of the alert
 * is 0. If successful, ``buffer`` points to a buffer containing all the data
 * of the piece. ``piece`` is the piece index that was read. ``size`` is the
 * number of bytes that was read.
 * <p/>
 * If the operation fails, ec will indicat what went wrong.
